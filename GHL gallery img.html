  <hr/>

  <p><strong>Background:</strong> In 1851, Queen Victoria's husband, Prince Albert, and a team of British exhibitors developed plans to build a gigantic glass exhibit hall (“The Crystal Palace") in central London. The exhibition it housed was entitled “The Great Exhibition to Display the Works of Industry of all Nations." After almost a century of industrialization, the organizers wanted to take stock of mechanical and artistic gains and inspire a future generation of innovators. They invited delegations of exhibitors from countries around the world. Displays ranged from huge agricultural reapers to faux-medieval sculpture to the Koh-i-Noor diamond from India. In the end, the exhibit was enormously successful. It started the tradition of “World's Fairs" at which citizens of different nations could evaluate the arts and manufactures of rivals and allies. World's Fairs still happen today. This week, you'll be thinking about why the first one happened at this moment as well as how such fairs developed in the next few decades. What image of world power did the Great Exhibition display? How did later fairs try to emulate the first one? What did countries achieve by staging a world's fair?</p>
  
  <p>These sources include images of the Crystal Palace created for the first World's Fair in 1851. </p>
